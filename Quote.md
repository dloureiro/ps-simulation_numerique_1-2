I heard a great quote yesterday in a blast analysis session at the ACI Convention in Pittsburgh. The presenter had a slide which conveyed the following:

> Simulations are believed by no one except those who conducted them.
> Experimental results are believed by everyone except those who conducted them.

Thats a great quote and quite true in my opinion (I can only speak on the simulation half). My experience is that if your numerical response doesn’t match experimental data, people like to point out that your analysis is off and can’t predict the response. On the other hand, if your numerical results match the experimental data, people think you falsified the data to get it to match.

Suspicion runs deep toward analytical folks, I think, largely because of a perception that we are not honest about the limitations of our models. Perhaps the analytical community needs to work to earn the trust of the larger engineering community?

The original quote is by Albert Einstein: 

> A theory is something nobody believes, except the person who made it. An experiment is something everybody believes, except the person who made it.
